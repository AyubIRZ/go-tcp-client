#Go TCP client

This is a simple TCP client that works with [AyubIRZ/go-tcp-server](https://github.com/AyubIRZ/go-tcp-server) as the communication server.
This project will evolve to a CLI chatting client-server app.

## Notes
- This is a simple demonstration of the project. You may not use it in production without reviewing the code and changing it to the proper version of your use!
- Data transmission between clients is not secured with TLS or authentication! It's simple and dumb!
-  Any contribution, PR or submitting issues using github issue tracker will be appreciated!
